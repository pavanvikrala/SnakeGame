# SnakeGame

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and the turtle module. The game allows the player to control a snake and navigate it around the screen to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to avoid colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body.

Here's the features of the game :
- The snake's movement can be controlled using the arrow keys.
- Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body.
- The score is displayed on the screen, representing the number of food items eaten.
- The game speed gradually increases as the snake grows longer, adding to the challenge.

You can play the game by cloning the repository üëç

This project is inspired by the classic snake game and is built using the turtle üê¢ module, which is part of the Python standard library.
